# Investment Calculator App

This is an Investment Calculator App built using React.js. The app allows users to input their initial investment, annual investment, expected return, and investment duration to calculate and display the investment growth over time in a tabular format.

## Features

- **User Input Fields:** 
  - **Initial Investment:** The starting amount of money invested.
  - **Annual Investment:** The amount of money added to the investment annually.
  - **Expected Return:** The annual percentage return expected on the investment.
  - **Duration:** The number of years the investment will be held.
- **Results Table:** Displays the year-by-year breakdown of the investment growth, including the total value at the end of each year.

## Functions

1. **Initial Investment**: The starting capital for the investment.
2. **Annual Investment**: The additional amount added to the investment every year.
3. **Expected Return**: The annual percentage return expected on the investment.
4. **Duration**: The number of years the investment will grow.

## How It Works

1. **Input Values**: Users input the initial investment, annual investment, expected return, and duration.
2. **Calculate Growth**: The app calculates the investment growth for each year based on the inputs.
3. **Display Results**: The results are displayed in a tabular format showing the total value at the end of each year.

## Example Calculation

Assume the following inputs:
- Initial Investment: $10,000
- Annual Investment: $5,000
